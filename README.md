Utopia DSN library is simple and lite library for parsing and managing Data Source Names or DSNs. This library aims to be as simple and easy to learn and use as possible. This library is maintained by the [Appwrite team](https://appwrite.io).

Although the library was built for the [Utopia Framework](https://github.com/utopia-php/framework) project, it is completely independent, **dependency-free** and can be used with any other PHP project or framework.

## Getting Started

Install using composer:
```bash
composer require utopia-php/dsn
```

```php
<?php

require_once '../vendor/autoload.php';

$dsn = new DSN('mariadb://user:password@localhost:3306/database?charset=utf8&timezone=UTC');
$scheme = $dsn->getScheme(); // mariadb
$user = $dsn->getUser(); // user
$password = $dsn->getPassword(); // password
$host = $dsn->getHost(); // localhost
$port = $dsn->getPort(); // 3306
$path = $dsn->getPath(); // database
$query = $dsn->getQuery(); // charset=utf8&timezone=UTC
```

## Tests

To run all unit tests, use the following Docker command:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd):rw -w $(pwd) php:8.0-cli-alpine sh -c "vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml tests"
```

To run the linter, use the following composer command:

```bash
composer lint

# Or if you do not have composer installed
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd):rw -w $(pwd) composer  sh -c "composer lint"
```

To fix the errors raised by the linter, use the following command:

```php
composer format

# Or if you do not have composer installed
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd):rw -w $(pwd) composer  sh -c "composer format"
```

## System Requirements

Utopia DSN requires PHP 8.0 or later. We recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.
